# CFD_FEA_Coupling_GUI
Repository for development of a GUI for coupled CFD and FEA solving. The goal of this project is to develop a Python GUI that will streamline the process of simultaneously running Computational Fluid Dynamics and Finite Element Analysis solvers for solid structures, namely for vehicles such as airplanes and automobiles via importing an STL file. 

At the moment, the GUI portion is nearing completion, but the program itself is not ready for deployment due to problems with OpenFOAM/Fenics coupling and other housekeeping tasks that need to be completed.
